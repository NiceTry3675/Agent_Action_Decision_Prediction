# Research Decision Log

This file is a short decision index, not the full experiment notebook.

Full historical log through 2026-07-06 is archived at
`archive/research_log_20260702_20260706.md`.

## Sources Of Truth

- Current submitted baseline: `final_summary.md`.
- Public calibration and submission ledger: `leaderboard_calibration.md`.
- Experiment rows and exact commands: `experiments/results.csv`.
- Detailed metrics, rules, bias vectors, and probe artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/*.json`.
- Active GPU handoff as of 2026-07-06: `handoff_20260706_gpu_plan.md`.
- The old planning directory was removed after the Qwen3/M8 pivot because it
  described the superseded XLM-R/length milestone plan.

## Logging Rules

- Keep this file short: decisions only, no confusion tables or per-class dumps.
- Do not restate the current baseline score here; link to `final_summary.md`
  instead, so the score cannot drift.
- New detailed experiment numbers go to `experiments/results.csv` and artifacts.
- Add only durable decisions or reversals here.

## Compressed History

- 2026-07-02: XLM-R replay + OOF rules + sparse SVC reached Public `0.743` and
  became the first working baseline. OOF calibrated better than fixed-session.
- 2026-07-03: Early serializer/length variants and alternative encoders mostly
  failed or became ensemble-only candidates. Colab command-channel reliability was
  hardened after runtime reclaim issues.
- 2026-07-04: Public-gated workflow replaced the earlier OOF gate for submission
  promotion; leak overrides were probed and rejected hard on Public (`0.710`).
  Encoder-family gains were too small/noisy to carry the target alone.
- 2026-07-05: Decoder models became the real break: Qwen2.5-0.5B refit reached
  Public `0.770`, then Qwen3-0.6B refit with OOF bias/rules reached Public
  `0.780`. This is the current baseline line.
- 2026-07-05: Qwen3.5-0.8B showed real OOF quality (`0.774046` after rules), but
  direct deployment timed out on the server. Work shifted from model-quality
  proof to inference-volume reduction.

## Recent Decisions

### 2026-07-06 - M8 cascade quality is valid, but timing needs volume reduction

- Evidence: M7 0.6B and M8 0.8B OOF logits over the same 70k rows show
  confidence routing works. Routing 15% of rows captures roughly half of the
  0.8B edge; routing 50% slightly beats 0.8B alone.
- Decision: Keep cascade as the main M8 deployment shape: 0.6B on all rows, 0.8B
  only on low-confidence rows, then tune bias/rules on blended OOF logits.
- Constraint: with current_v1 and fp16 DeltaNet, r=15% still projects around
  `733s`, requiring server speedup `s >= 1.22`.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/20260706_cascade_routing_sim.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v5 is rejected as a quality replacement

- Evidence: Qwen3-0.6B current_v5 OOF landed below current_v1 at every tier:
  raw `0.751161` vs `0.755929`, 2-stage `0.755129` vs `0.758499`, rules
  `0.761686` vs `0.767129`.
- Decision: Do not replace current_v1 with current_v5 for quality.
- Follow-up: v5's token savings remain useful only if a minimal v6 recovers the
  loss without giving up most of the speed benefit.
- Artifacts: `experiments/artifacts/v5_qwen3_06b_oof_len384_ep3_oof_metrics.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/v5_qwen3_06b_oof_len384_ep3_rules_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - xmeta rule recovery failed

- Evidence: Adding v5-dropped meta fields back into the rule vocabulary recovered
  only `+0.0002` on v5 rules and did not help v1.
- Decision: The v5 loss is not recoverable by coarse rule flags for
  tier/language preference/budget/elapsed/loc. Treat the likely culprits as turn
  exactness, language dominance representation, or transformer-internal
  interactions.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/v5_qwen3_06b_oof_rules_xmeta_rule_boosts.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/m7_qwen3_oof_rules_xmeta_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - fp16 DeltaNet fallback is adopted for the 0.8B cascade leg

- Evidence: `fp16_state` matched stock argmax on 99.976% of 4096 rows and sped the
  trained 0.8B eager fallback by about 1.21x, reducing the ratio from 2.43 to
  2.01.
- Decision: Use fp16 DeltaNet in the 0.8B leg, gated by package-level smoke. The
  implementation must rebind each layer instance's `chunk_gated_delta_rule`;
  module-global monkeypatching after model load does not execute.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/m8_fp16_deltanet_probe.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v6 minimum spec is fixed

- Evidence: Structural rule probes over turn_x/trigram/result/candidate/path/
  overlap/open_n were effectively null: `0.767109` vs baseline rules `0.767129`.
- Decision: Do not add a struct line to v6. current_v6 is only current_v5 plus
  exact-turn/bin pairing and language dominance marker.
- Implementation state: `script.py` and `train_transformer.py` now register
  `current_v6`.
- Spec: `fe_current_v6_spec.md`.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/m7_qwen3_oof_rules_struct_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - depth-cut is rejected

- Evidence: M8 layer-saturation probing showed no early plateau. K=16 retained
  94.9% of final-layer probe F1; K=20 retained 96.9%, implying too much quality
  loss for the timing saved.
- Decision: Do not pursue depth-cut/refit as an M8 deployment lever.
- Remaining path: token reduction via v6, row reduction via cascade, fp16 DeltaNet
  for the routed 0.8B rows.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/m8_depthcut_layer_probe.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - M8 compile-cache timeout probe was shape-contaminated

- Evidence: `submissions/m8_ep3_cc.zip` ships `hf_meta.compile.batch_size=64`
  with buckets `{256,400}`, but its embedded Inductor cache contains generated
  input-shape guards for `(128,192)` and no `(64,...)` input cache. The cache
  appears to come from the maxpack batch-128/config-A path rather than the
  submitted batch-64 path.
- Decision: Do not use the `m8_ep3_cc.zip` timeout as strong evidence that a
  correctly baked compile-cache path cannot run. The eager timeout still proves
  direct stock fallback is too slow, but the compile-cache submission likely
  cold-compiled or cache-missed on the server.
- Follow-up: Any future compile-cache package must bake and verify cache shapes
  against the exact `hf_meta.compile` batch size and buckets before submission.

### 2026-07-06 - M8 C-lane timing closes the all-row 0.8B path

- Evidence: C-lane exact b64/{256,400} cache guard rebuilt the intended cache on
  trained weights and fp16 DeltaNet matched stock on the correctness slice
  (`argmax_agreement=1.0`, max diff `0.0088`, 18 rebound layers). The cache no
  longer showed batch-128 contamination, but `torch.compile` still opened long
  CPU-bound compile work during measure/warm-cache execution, so Colab/Public CPU
  differences aside, the current compile-cache recipe is not package-ready.
- Evidence: no-compile eager fp16 DeltaNet timing on the same C-lane T4:
  Qwen3 denominator `74.98s/4096`; M8 `current_v6:352` `109.61s/4096`
  (ratio `1.462`, projected `699s` on the M7 infer anchor), `current_v6:384`
  `733.6s` projected, `current_v6:400` `733.4s`, and `current_v1:400`
  `914.8s`.
- Decision: 0.8B all-row standalone is still over the 10-minute target even with
  fp16 DeltaNet and `current_v6:352`. Use M8 only as a routed/cascade leg unless
  a new non-compile kernel lever appears; `current_v6:352` permits roughly
  `<=86%` of rows through M8 under a 600s infer budget.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_b64_cache_guard_measure.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_fp16_eager_v6_len.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - inference loader fixed for int8 decoder packages

- Evidence: `script.py` reconstructed int8-codec weights as fp32, loaded a fp32
  model, moved it to GPU, and only then converted to half in the caller. Decoder
  configs also kept `use_cache=True` in saved config, relying on library-version
  defaults during sequence-classification inference.
- Decision: `script.py` now restores int8 weights directly to fp16 on CUDA,
  halves the model before loading, moves only the half model to GPU, and
  explicitly disables decoder cache on model configs. Local offline smoke passed
  on the current package.

### 2026-07-06 - FLA Triton autotune workaround probe is ready

- Context: The strongest FLA repro reached the fast path but failed inside
  Triton's autotuner while compiling Gated DeltaNet KKT/solve on T4. Earlier
  causal-conv install failures were not decisive; the failure to close is the
  T4 Triton compile path itself.
- Prepared probe: `colab/m8_fla_autotune_workaround_probe.py` tests two
  workarounds in isolated subprocesses: FLA 0.5.1 `FLA_CACHE_MODE=default`
  config files to skip autotune, and runtime Autotuner narrowing to one config
  per relevant kernel. First gate is one-batch correctness/survival; only then
  run full timing.
- Result: C-lane T4 smoke showed `fastpath_active=True`, but FLA 0.5.1 failed
  all tested KKT/solve configs (`BK` 32/64 x warps 1/2/4) under both
  config-cache and Autotuner-narrowed paths. FLA 0.5.0 also failed all six
  narrowed KKT/solve configs. Every failure was the same Triton
  `PassManager::run failed` at `chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_kkt_solve_kernel`.
- Decision: Treat current FLA fast path as closed for the server-matched
  T4/torch2.7.1/triton3.3.1 stack. A real fix would require rewriting or
  replacing the KTT/solve Triton kernel, not just picking a safer autotune
  config.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_fla_autotune_smoke.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_fla_kkt_grid.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_fla050_kkt_grid.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - causal-conv1d-only is not a speed lever

- Evidence: C-lane T4 A/B installed only `causal_conv1d 1.6.2.post1` after a
  no-causal baseline, with FLA absent in both variants. The causal variant
  activated `causal_conv1d_fn` in all 18 DeltaNet layers and preserved logits on
  the correctness slice (`argmax_agreement=1.0`, max diff `0.0156`).
- Result: same-runtime `current_v6:352` timing over 4096 rows was no-causal
  `112.36s` infer / `114.69s` tokenize+infer versus causal-only `112.47s`
  infer / `114.53s` tokenize+infer. Infer was `0.1%` slower; tokenize+infer was
  `0.14%` faster due to tokenization noise. The projected all-row M8 time stays
  about `698s`, far above the 600s target.
- Decision: causal-conv1d is usable but not useful for this sequence-classifier
  prefill workload. Close it as a deployment lever; the real bottleneck remains
  DeltaNet fallback scan/recurrence, not the short depthwise conv.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_causal_only_ab.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_causal_only_ab_no_causal.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_c_m8_causal_only_ab_causal_only.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v6e is the final serializer-compression probe

- Evidence: current_v6's fixed screen narrowly beat v5 at the aggregate but
  shifted too many ambiguous `read_file` rows into `list_directory`/`grep_search`.
- Decision: Test one guarded variant before closing the serializer-compression
  lane: current_v5 + exact turn + `path/overlap/cand` explorer evidence, while
  reverting v6's language-dominance marker back to v5 top-2 language names.
- Spec: `fe_current_v6e_spec.md`.
- Gate: Qwen3-0.6B fixed screen at `max_length=400`; only OOF if read/list/ask
  class behavior recovers enough to justify a full fold set.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v6 OOF is not a v1 replacement

- Evidence: current_v6 fixed screen was only a narrow pass over v5
  (`0.764251` vs `0.763387`) and stayed below the v1 fixed anchor
  (`0.770875`). The 3-fold OOF aggregate was `0.756118`, above v5 OOF
  (`0.755129`) but below v1 OOF (`0.758499`).
- Evidence: deterministic rule tuning finished at `0.762935`, beating v5
  +rules (`0.761686`) but missing M7/v1 +rules (`0.767129`) by `0.004194`.
  Weak classes after rules: `list_directory=0.4798`, `read_file=0.5843`,
  `grep_search=0.6018`, `glob_pattern=0.6572`, `ask_user=0.6604`.
- Decision: Do not promote current_v6 as a final M7 replacement or Public
  package. Keep it as compression/timing evidence; current_v6e remains the last
  guarded serializer-compression probe before returning to current_v1
  cascade/timing work.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_current_v6_qwen3_06b_token_lengths.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/v6_qwen3_06b_oof_len384_ep3_oof_metrics.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/v6_qwen3_06b_oof_len384_ep3_rules_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v6e fixed screen closes serializer compression

- Evidence: exact-spec `current_v6e` len400 batch16 hit sustained fp16 NaN from
  step 1500 onward and was killed before producing a result. Cache was freshly
  rebuilt on the VM, so this was not stale-cache contamination.
- Result: stability rerun with `batch_size=8`, `grad_accum_steps=2` (effective
  batch 16) completed at fixed-screen macro `0.764074` (`raw=0.757528`,
  `bias=0.762722`). This is above v5 (`0.763387`) but just below v6
  (`0.764251`) and far below the v1 fixed anchor (`0.770875`).
- Weak classes after 2-stage: `list_directory=0.4795`, `read_file=0.5809`,
  `grep_search=0.6034`, `glob_pattern=0.6393`, `ask_user=0.6730`. The
  intended `read_file` recovery was partial but missed the `0.59` target, and
  the aggregate did not clear v6.
- Decision: Do not run current_v6e OOF. Close the Qwen3-0.6B serializer
  compression lane and return to current_v1 cascade/timing work before spending
  a Public slot.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_current_v6e_qwen3_06b_token_lengths.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/20260706_094913_gpu_transformer_session_current_v6e_len400_replay-last1_v6e_qwen3_06b_screen_b8a2_metrics.json`,
  `experiments/logits/20260706_094913_gpu_transformer_session_current_v6e_len400_replay-last1_v6e_qwen3_06b_screen_b8a2_val_logits.pt`.

## Current Next Step

Return to current_v1 cascade/timing work before spending a Public slot. The
serializer-compression lane is closed unless a new OOF-diversity hypothesis
appears.
