# Research Decision Log

This file is a short decision index, not the full experiment notebook.

Full historical log through 2026-07-06 is archived at
`archive/research_log_20260702_20260706.md`.

## Sources Of Truth

- Current submitted baseline: `final_summary.md`.
- Public calibration and submission ledger: `leaderboard_calibration.md`.
- Experiment rows and exact commands: `experiments/results.csv`.
- Detailed metrics, rules, bias vectors, and probe artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/*.json`.
- Active GPU handoff as of 2026-07-06: `handoff_20260706_gpu_plan.md`.
- The old planning directory was removed after the Qwen3/M8 pivot because it
  described the superseded XLM-R/length milestone plan.

## Logging Rules

- Keep this file short: decisions only, no confusion tables or per-class dumps.
- Do not restate the current baseline score here; link to `final_summary.md`
  instead, so the score cannot drift.
- New detailed experiment numbers go to `experiments/results.csv` and artifacts.
- Add only durable decisions or reversals here.

## Compressed History

- 2026-07-02: XLM-R replay + OOF rules + sparse SVC reached Public `0.743` and
  became the first working baseline. OOF calibrated better than fixed-session.
- 2026-07-03: Early serializer/length variants and alternative encoders mostly
  failed or became ensemble-only candidates. Colab command-channel reliability was
  hardened after runtime reclaim issues.
- 2026-07-04: Public-gated workflow replaced the earlier OOF gate for submission
  promotion; leak overrides were probed and rejected hard on Public (`0.710`).
  Encoder-family gains were too small/noisy to carry the target alone.
- 2026-07-05: Decoder models became the real break: Qwen2.5-0.5B refit reached
  Public `0.770`, then Qwen3-0.6B refit with OOF bias/rules reached Public
  `0.780`. This is the current baseline line.
- 2026-07-05: Qwen3.5-0.8B showed real OOF quality (`0.774046` after rules), but
  direct deployment timed out on the server. Work shifted from model-quality
  proof to inference-volume reduction.

## Recent Decisions

### 2026-07-06 - M8 cascade quality is valid, but timing needs volume reduction

- Evidence: M7 0.6B and M8 0.8B OOF logits over the same 70k rows show
  confidence routing works. Routing 15% of rows captures roughly half of the
  0.8B edge; routing 50% slightly beats 0.8B alone.
- Decision: Keep cascade as the main M8 deployment shape: 0.6B on all rows, 0.8B
  only on low-confidence rows, then tune bias/rules on blended OOF logits.
- Constraint: with current_v1 and fp16 DeltaNet, r=15% still projects around
  `733s`, requiring server speedup `s >= 1.22`.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/20260706_cascade_routing_sim.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v5 is rejected as a quality replacement

- Evidence: Qwen3-0.6B current_v5 OOF landed below current_v1 at every tier:
  raw `0.751161` vs `0.755929`, 2-stage `0.755129` vs `0.758499`, rules
  `0.761686` vs `0.767129`.
- Decision: Do not replace current_v1 with current_v5 for quality.
- Follow-up: v5's token savings remain useful only if a minimal v6 recovers the
  loss without giving up most of the speed benefit.
- Artifacts: `experiments/artifacts/v5_qwen3_06b_oof_len384_ep3_oof_metrics.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/v5_qwen3_06b_oof_len384_ep3_rules_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - xmeta rule recovery failed

- Evidence: Adding v5-dropped meta fields back into the rule vocabulary recovered
  only `+0.0002` on v5 rules and did not help v1.
- Decision: The v5 loss is not recoverable by coarse rule flags for
  tier/language preference/budget/elapsed/loc. Treat the likely culprits as turn
  exactness, language dominance representation, or transformer-internal
  interactions.
- Artifacts:
  `experiments/artifacts/v5_qwen3_06b_oof_rules_xmeta_rule_boosts.json`,
  `experiments/artifacts/m7_qwen3_oof_rules_xmeta_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - fp16 DeltaNet fallback is adopted for the 0.8B cascade leg

- Evidence: `fp16_state` matched stock argmax on 99.976% of 4096 rows and sped the
  trained 0.8B eager fallback by about 1.21x, reducing the ratio from 2.43 to
  2.01.
- Decision: Use fp16 DeltaNet in the 0.8B leg, gated by package-level smoke. The
  implementation must rebind each layer instance's `chunk_gated_delta_rule`;
  module-global monkeypatching after model load does not execute.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/m8_fp16_deltanet_probe.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - current_v6 minimum spec is fixed

- Evidence: Structural rule probes over turn_x/trigram/result/candidate/path/
  overlap/open_n were effectively null: `0.767109` vs baseline rules `0.767129`.
- Decision: Do not add a struct line to v6. current_v6 is only current_v5 plus
  exact-turn/bin pairing and language dominance marker.
- Implementation state: `script.py` and `train_transformer.py` now register
  `current_v6`.
- Spec: `fe_current_v6_spec.md`.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/m7_qwen3_oof_rules_struct_rule_boosts.json`.

### 2026-07-06 - depth-cut is rejected

- Evidence: M8 layer-saturation probing showed no early plateau. K=16 retained
  94.9% of final-layer probe F1; K=20 retained 96.9%, implying too much quality
  loss for the timing saved.
- Decision: Do not pursue depth-cut/refit as an M8 deployment lever.
- Remaining path: token reduction via v6, row reduction via cascade, fp16 DeltaNet
  for the routed 0.8B rows.
- Artifact: `experiments/artifacts/m8_depthcut_layer_probe.json`.

## Current Next Step

Follow `handoff_20260706_gpu_plan.md`: screen current_v6 on Qwen3-0.6B, then
decide whether to run v6 OOF/refit and build the cascade pack. If v6 misses,
fall back to current_v1 cascade math and ask before spending a Public slot on
the timing gamble.
